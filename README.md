Customer Question Answering Chatbot
This project is a fine-tuned BERT-based-Chinese chatbot designed to answer customer questions using a pre-existing knowledge base stored in an Excel file. The chatbot encodes customer queries and compares them with the most similar questions from the knowledge base using cosine similarity to provide relevant answers.
